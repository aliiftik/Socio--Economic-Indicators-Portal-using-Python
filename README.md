Project title: 
Socio- Economic Indicators Portal using Python
Abstract:
Socio-economic indicators for different countries are present on different website for agencies like World Health Organization and World Bank. As the data is in different formats, we created a program that will compare and analyze performance of ten socio-economic indicators like GDP per capita, infant mortality etc., for ten South Asian Countries for ten years.  Data on the public websites was in the form of API, JSON, CSV or text. So, we used API function call and web scraping to extract and integrate the data. Different packages used during the data extraction process were JSON, pandas.io.json, requests, urlib.request and Beautiful Soup. The final program shows a countryâ€™s profile, compare indicators for different South Asia country and allow the user to find the correlation for any two indicators for a country.
